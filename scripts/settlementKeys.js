    "LogHelpConfig_Info_1" : "!1q4! This game is a <color=#df840e>simulation building survival game</color>, you not only need to <color=#df840e>develop your town</color>, but also need to <color=#df840e>maintain the survival of the citizens</color>. If the basic survival needs are not met, the citizens will <color=#df840e>die</color>, and maintaining survival under high difficulty will be a major problem in the early stage. Even after the development and expansion of the town, it is easy to face severe survival problems due to disasters or population growth. We believe that after multiple death retries, you will be able to find a way to lead the survivors to survive and develop. If you feel difficult, you can choose to start a new game and reduce the difficulty of the game.\n      \n      Before officially starting the game, you need to know how to view the data of each area and town on the map.\n      Press <color=#df840e>M</color> to open the <color=#df840e>mini map</color>, view the basic information of the map, and see the random seed of the map.\n      \n      Press <color=#df840e>I</color> to open the Town Details. Here you can view the number of all <color=#df840e>professions</color> and <color=#df840e>buildings</color>, and you can click the button to go to a column to <color=#df840e>locate</color> directly, and multiple clicks will switch among multiple citizens or buildings. The details also include the production, use and inventory of various materials to help you check whether the <color=#df840e>supply</color> of materials meets the demand. In the inventory, you can also set the <color=#df840e>priority</color> of items. The smaller number means the higher priority. You can ban the items if you want them only used for production instead of consumption. In addition, population change curves and unlocked seeds, animals, and blueprints can be checked here.\n      \n      The most important thing in the game is to ensure the <color=#df840e>happy life of citizens</color>.\n      \n      The most urgent task in the early stage is to <color=#df840e>satisfy the survival needs of citizens</color>. You need to ensure there are enough <color=#df840e>food, drinking water, housing and heating</color>, otherwise it will be difficult to survive in the harsh environment. You can check the more detailed elaboration on basic survial methods in <color=#df840e>Help - Survival</color>.\n      After having basic living materials, we must pay attention to <color=#df840e>the happiness and health</color> of the citizens, develop <color=#df840e>industries</color> to improve the livability, and increase the <color=#df840e>population</color>.\n      You will also need to pay attention to the stress of citizens if you want to increase the population. Higher happiness and health, and more available houses can encourage the citizens to have children. For more information, please check the <color=#df840e>Help - Citizen Stress and Fertility Rate</color>.\n      Citizens need hospitals to treat illnesses and need Herbs and Soaps to maintain their health. Note that long-term consumption of raw foods can reduce health.\n      Churches can effectively prevent citizens from committing crimes, but higher happiness requires wine, sweets, and high-quality food.\n      In <color=#df840e>Help - Citizens' Happiness</color> and <color=#df840e>Help - Citizens' Health</color>, the reasons for the reduction and improvement of happiness and health will be introduced in details.\n      After the population grows, you can choose the administrator, and talented managers can bring many benefits to your town. When the development of science and technology is slow, education needs to be developed to accelerate the acquisition of technology points. You can choose the industrial chain based on your existing materials and obtain the missing parts through trade.\n      For more information about advanced development, you can check <color=#df840e>Help - Town Development</color>.",

There are many ways to obtain food, including gathering and hunting, which can provide <color=#df840e>opportunities to acquire seeds and cubs</color> as well as other food sources.\n      \n      <color=#df840e>Gathering</color> is a method of obtaining food where you can collect wild plants and have the opportunity to acquire some <color=#df840e>seeds</color>. Gathers in the Gatherers Hut will collect wild plants within the building’s range.\n      \n      <color=#df840e>Hunting</color> is a method of obtaining meat and other animal by-products, such as Leather, and also provides the opportunity to obtain animal <color=#df840e>cubs</color>. The hunting range of hunters is the whole map, but animals nearby will be prioritized. Note that hunters cannot hunt animals across lands without bridges.\n      \n      <color=#df840e>Agriculture</color>: You can arrange planting once you obtain seeds. Most crops are edible, and there are differences in yield and cold resistance between different crops. Crops should be <color=#df840e>planted during the proper season and temperature</color>, and they need to ripen before workers can harvest them. You can also manually harvest crops that are not fully mature, but this will reduce the yield. Late or slow sowing may result in incomplete planting, causing crops to mature later. Crops that are <color=#df840e>not harvested in winter are likely to die</color>. To ensure smooth planting and harvesting, sufficient manpower must be allocated to the farmland. However, if farmers in a certain field can already handle all the work and harvest all the crops before winter, assigning more workers would be unnecessary. During the slack season, farmers can assist laborers with transporting and gathering work without having to lay them off.\n      \n      <color=#df840e>Animal husbandry</color>: Raising livestock in the Pasture requires acquiring animal cubs, which can be obtained through <color=#df840e>hunting and trading</color>. Even one animal in a pasture can multiply, but the reproduction speed slows down when the number of animals is low. Note that animals have a certain lifespan, and if they are not kept in the pasture for a long time after being captured, they will die. The output of the pasture depends on what animals are raised there. Products such as Eggs and Dried Dung are <color=#df840e>produced daily</color>, while Meat and Leather are obtained by <color=#df840e>slaughtering animals</color>. The number of animals kept alive in the pasture can be set manually. When the total amount of animals exceeds the set number, the extra will be slaughtered. If all animals in a pasture are slaughtered, then the raising process will be stopped.\n      \n      <color=#df840e>Fishery</color>: The output of the Fishing Dock is affected by the Fishing Point buff and the size of the water area, and the output will decrease when the effect ranges of multiple Fishing Docks are overlapped. In contrast, the Fish Pond has a more stable output.\n      \n      <color=#df840e>Orchard</color>: Fruits are not only a source of food, but they can also be used as materials to produce Fancy Food.
